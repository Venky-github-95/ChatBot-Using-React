ChatBot AI Using React.js & Express.js
	
	A Chatbot AI using React (for the frontend) and Express (for the backend) typically involves setting up a user interface where users can interact with the chatbot and a backend server that processes the conversation and responds with the appropriate AI-generated reply.
	
1. Frontend (React)
React is used to build the interactive user interface (UI) for the chatbot. It handles the UI components where users can input their messages, display chat history, and interact with the chatbot.
Components: React components are used to build pages (e.g., Home, Chatbot page) and reusable elements (e.g., Chat message box, input fields, buttons).
State Management: React manages the chat state (messages sent and received) using hooks like useState.
Axios or Fetch API: React communicates with the backend Express server via HTTP requests (using libraries like Axios) to send user inputs and receive chatbot responses.

2. Backend (Express)
Express is a backend framework for Node.js, used to set up the server-side logic for processing user requests. It serves as an API that React communicates with, and it can integrate with AI services (like GPT, Google Gemini, or custom-trained models) to generate chatbot responses.
Routing: Express handles the routing for API requests, such as sending a user’s message and getting the bot’s response.
API Calls: Express can make API calls to third-party services (like GPT-3, Google Gemini, or DialogFlow) to generate chatbot responses based on the user input.
Environment Variables: Express can securely manage API keys and other configurations through environment variables, stored in a .env file.

Implementation : 
Firstly to install necessary packages
Set up Backend (Express):
mkdir chatbot-backend
cd chatbot-backend
npm init -y
npm install express axios dotenv cors


Set up Frontend (React):
npx create-react-app chatbot-frontend
cd chatbot-frontend
npm install axios
AI Integration:
For Google Gemini: Install the @google/generative-ai package.
npm install @google/generative-ai

Set up .env for storing API keys:
Create a .env file in the backend project directory to store your API keys securely:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
